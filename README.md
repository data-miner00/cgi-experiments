# CGI Experiments

Doing some experiments on the [Common Gateway Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface).

## Prequisites

Make sure that Perl5 is installed.

```
perl -v
```

Next, the [CGI Module](https://metacpan.org/dist/CGI/view/lib/CGI.pod) is required for CGI related features. Use cpanm for faster installations.

## Change script to executable

Make sure that the CGI scripts are executable, otherwise they will not work.

```
sudo chmod +x myscript.pl
```
